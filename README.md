## UX

### **Strategy**

Considering the core UX principles I first started to think about the strategy for this website and defined who the target users would be and what features/technologies they would want.

Living Life On The Veg's target users are:
* Aged 18+
* Past/future health experts
* People interested in eating healthy on a budget
* Have an interest in changing there lifestyles

What these users would be looking for:
* Clear, concise, easy-to-find information
* Videos that provide inspiration and make the lifestyle choice look desirable
* Helpful guidance on routes available
* Recommendations for where and what to eat

This website will offer all of these things whilst also allowing for intuitive navigation and comfortability of use. An effort was taken to not provide an overwhelming amount of information at first glance as this is often the reason people are put off with healthy lifestyles.

Due to the age group of the users, it is assumed that most users will be viewing the site on their mobile phones and therefore creating something responsive is integral to the design.

### **Scope**
