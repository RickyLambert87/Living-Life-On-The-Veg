## UX

### **Strategy**

Considering the core UX principles I first started to think about the strategy for this website and defined who the target users would be and what features/technologies they would want.

Living Life On The Veg's target users are:
* Aged 18+
* Past/future health experts
* People interested in eating healthy on a budget
* Have an interest in changing there lifestyles

What these users would be looking for:
* Clear, concise, easy-to-find information
* Videos that provide inspiration and make the lifestyle choice look desirable
* Helpful guidance on routes available
* Recommendations for where and what to eat

This website will offer all of these things whilst also allowing for intuitive navigation and comfortability of use. An effort was taken to not provide an overwhelming amount of information at first glance as this is often the reason people are put off with healthy lifestyles.

Due to the age group of the users, it is assumed that most users will be viewing the site on their mobile phones and therefore creating something responsive is integral to the design.

### **Scope**
In order to achieve the desired user & business goals, the following features will be included in this release:

- Header and menu bar, to navigate to various sections of the page
- Growing section full of tips for growing food
- Videos with information on growing food
- sign up form
- Links to affiliate social media pages

### **Structure** 

This is a three-page website, I chose the following order for the information 'Home > The Human Body > Lets Grow > Keep in Touch', as I felt this would allow the information to be digested in the best way. The text blocks are broken up with images to ensure interest is kept and there is no information overload at any point. There is a simple sign up form for users to sign up to Living Life On The Veg.

### **Skeleton**

[Wireframes](/docs/wireframes.pdf)

Please note the actual website has changed slightly from these wireframes.

Whilst building the website I felt that there were sections with too much information and also i didnt feel it worked once i had it in place with images and my content for this reason I opted to go for the animation approach as i wanted to see how it worked and looked overall.


### **Surface**

I chose a colour palette based around red & beige as these colours remind me of autumn and also resembles the background i chose for my animation, I want the users of this website to be able to get clear information easily and also have videos to watch instead of reading and believe these colours will help to do this. 

I used Google fonts 'Cookie' and 'Raleway' across the entire website, I felt 'Cookie' was a fun text and stood out on the page but I also wanted something easier to read for the large blocks of texts which is why I chose 'Raleway' for the body text, example below:

## **Features**

This is a fully responsive website that was designed mobile-first as this is the most likely way it will be viewed; the page is divided into the four sections listed in the navbar. Where a colour background has been used it has a slightly transparent opacity and the text is off-white. All of the headings use the font Cookie and the body text is Raleway, this consistency has been used across the website to create a coherent design. 

### *Navbar*
The navbar is placed on top of a responsive image which acts as a header, when viewed on smaller screens I opted for the menu to collapse into a hamburger icon as I still wanted to image to be seen. The image I have chosen is representative of the site's theme and incorporates the colour palette, it immediately encourages the user to think of being on holiday and entices them to read further. 

### *About*
This is where I introduce myself and the page and give a brief insight into why it was created, I have used an H2 element for the main heading, followed by an H3 tag line and then a more descriptive paragraph. I wanted to keep this section simple and clean as there is plenty of information that follows.  

### *Travel Tips 101*
This section starts with an H2 heading and is then followed by a series of H4 and P elements, this structure is used to provide clarity of the items within this section and make it easy to understand at a glance. This also allows the users to direct their attention to a particular section they a more interested in. Within the p elements, there are several clickable links for products mentioned, this enables the user to easily navigate their way to recommended products creating a trusting relationship between the author and user.
There is also an Essentials list of items to pack when travelling, on smaller screens this list appears under the Travel Tips and on larger screens (1440px+) it is alongside it. This list is also available as a downloadable document so that users can print this list to use when packing. 

### *My Last Trip*
This section includes the most information on the page and so I wanted to include imagery alongside text. The title is an H2 element that is set underneath a responsive hero image, this is followed by a concise review of Sri Lanka. The review is built using H4 and p elements with icons from FontAwesome. 
There is then a separate div that contains a far more detailed review of Sri Lanka, this features a map embedded using GoogleMaps and also a read more/read less button. I want users to read this information only if they want to and not have an overwhelming amount of text on their screen. 
I have then included a Fancybox gallery of images of my trip to Sri Lanka, this uses 2 Fancybox libraries that have been included at the bottom of my HTML code.

### *Keep in touch*
This is a signup form that will allow the user to sign up for La Petite Traveller's newsletter. There is an H2 & H3 providing information regarding the form and an animated arrow guiding the user's attention to the form below. The form uses 3 elements, 2 text inputs and an email input. They are all required therefore all information is necessary to submit the form. The colour pallet used is the same across the site.
